## ✨ Features & CSS Concepts Covered

### 🔹 1. Selectors

- Universal (`*`), Element (`h1`), Class (`.box`), ID (`#home`)
- Used to target elements cleanly and consistently

### 🔹 2. Box Model

- Applied `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `border-radius` across sections
- Helps space elements without breaking layouts

### 🔹 3. Typography

- Google Fonts (`Poppins`) for a modern, readable look
- Font size, weight, spacing, and colors for headings and paragraphs

### 🔹 4. Flexbox

- Used to create responsive navbars and social icon layouts
- Properties used: `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `gap`

### 🔹 5. Grid

- Applied for creating responsive **project card layout**
- Properties used: `grid-template-columns`, `auto-fit`, `minmax`, `gap`

### 🔹 6. Transitions & Hover Effects

- Smooth animations on buttons, links, and project cards
- Properties used: `transition`, `transform`, `:hover`

### 🔹 7. Media Queries (Responsive Design)

- Layout and typography adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Implemented with `@media (max-width: 768px)`

### 🔹 8. Pseudo-classes & Pseudo-elements

- Styled elements using `:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child`, `::before`, and `::after`
- Added emojis and text effects without extra HTML

### 🔹 9. CSS Variables (Optional)
